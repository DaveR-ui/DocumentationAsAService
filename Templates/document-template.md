# Document Template

## Problem

A corpus without a fixed note shape degenerates into arbitrary structures, missing metadata, and
tools that cannot rely on any of it. Without a template, manual maintenance becomes the bottleneck.

## Solution

Copy this file for every new note. The frontmatter is the machine API (7 required keys;
`supersedes`/`expires_at` optional, format-checked only when present, never present-but-blank).
The seven body sections give every note the same outline, so a reader always knows where to look
for the problem, the solution, and the boundaries. Body wikilinks use filename stems
(`[[payments]]`); `related` uses ids (`payments-flow`); choose destinations with intention,
not as filler.

## When to use

When creating ANY new note in the wiki layer. Without complete frontmatter and all seven
sections, the note is not part of the corpus.

## When not to use

For files outside the wiki layer (repo READMEs, configs, generated artifacts). Hubs may shorten
sections but must keep the complete frontmatter.

# My Topic

## Problem
What concrete problem this note solves. One or two sentences.

## Solution
How it is solved, with the necessary technical detail.

## When to use
In what situations to apply this solution.

## When not to use
In what situations NOT to apply it.

## Examples
Code fragments or concrete scenarios.

## Common mistakes
Frequent pitfalls and misunderstandings.

## References
Sources and links to related notes (for example [[payments]]).
```

## Common mistakes

- Omitting a required key that has no value (keep it with an empty list).
- Renaming or translating section headings — breaks the outline parsing the whole system relies on.
- Leaving `related` disconnected from the body's wikilinks: both sources should agree so the
  graph and the metadata stay coherent.
