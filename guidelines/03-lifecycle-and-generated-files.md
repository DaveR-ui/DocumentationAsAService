# Lifecycle & Generated Files

## Problem

Two different rot mechanisms destroy corpora: documents that silently become false, and tools
that regenerate files straight through the human edits embedded in them. Both need *contracts*,
not goodwill.

## Solution

### 1. Document lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> draft
    draft --> active : reviewed, matches reality
    active --> superseded : a successor note carries supersedes: this-id
    active --> expired : expires_at passed (still readable, flagged)
    superseded --> archived : moved out of the served root
    expired --> active : reviewed and renewed (new version)
    archived --> [*]
```

- **`status` is a claim, not a mood.** `active` means "trust this"; anything else means "read with
  suspicion". The enum is fixed; a status outside it is an error at review.
- **Supersede, don't rewrite.** When knowledge is replaced, write the successor with
  `supersedes: old-id` and flip the predecessor's status — the old note stays as history with a
  pointer forward. Decision records (ADRs) are *append-only by contract*: an addendum block, never
  an edit of the original text. They live in the root `ADRs/` folder behind its `adr-index.md`
  hub, named `adr-NNNN-<slug>.md` (see the anatomy in [01-structure.md](01-structure.md)).
- **`expires_at` is for claims with a shelf life** (roadmaps, version-bound behavior, "as of
  2026-09"). Strict `YYYY-MM-DD`, format-checked only when present. An expired-but-`active` note
  is the classic first row to add to your catalog — 04 invites extending it "with what actually
  bites you".

### 2. Generated-file contract

Root `index.md` — and its sibling `tag-index.md`, the tag → docs inverted index (plus any hub
that aggregates) — are machine-generated in **marker-delimited regions**, one region per artifact
(`index`, `tags`), rebuilt by the same generator:

```markdown
This text is human-owned and survives regeneration.

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: index -->
## Overview
- Notes indexed: 4
…
<!-- END GENERATED: index -->
```

Binding rules for every generated artifact:

1. **Regions, not files.** Human notes live outside the markers; tools touch only their regions.
2. **Write-if-diff.** Byte-stable output on unchanged input → zero VCS noise, meaningful diffs,
   committable artifacts. A generated file that dirties the working tree on every run is broken.
3. **The generator reads, humans review.** `index.md` shows counts, the tree, and hub pointers —
   it is the *first page* an agent reads (see [05-agent-navigation.md](05-agent-navigation.md)).
4. **Generated content is rebuilt, never rescued.** If a generated region is lost or corrupted,
   rerunning the generator restores it with zero hand-editing. If the generator can't rebuild it,
   it was never generated content — it belongs outside the markers.

### 3. Staleness must be visible

Every generated file carries the date of the snapshot it represents — a footer date is enough.
Silent staleness is a lie by omission; visible staleness lets the reader decide.

### 4. Version-bump policy

`version` is `MAJOR.MINOR` (a `PATCH` digit is legal for wording-only fixes):

| Change to a file | Bump |
|---|---|
| normative, schema, or structural | MINOR |
| pure wording / typo | PATCH (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) |
| contract-breaking | MAJOR — requires an ADR |

- **Baseline**: a context-doc receiving the `version` key for the first time starts at `1.0`.
  A file receiving `version` for the first time *and* normatively changed in the same batch lands
  at `1.1` (the batch's MINOR applies); receiving the key with no content change (e.g. guideline
  07) lands at `1.0`.
- **Cadence**: every touched file bumps `version` **and** refreshes `last_updated` in the same
  change.

## When to use

The moment the corpus is used by anything automated, or grows past "I remember everything".

## When not to use

A three-file scratch repo doesn't need generated regions; adopt the lifecycle the first time an
unread doc's trustworthiness gets questioned, and markers the first time a tool writes into a
human file.

## Examples

A filled instance of every marker rule, including a generated index region, sits inline in
[`../guidelines/09-bootstrap-workflow.md`](../guidelines/09-bootstrap-workflow.md).

## Common mistakes

- Editing an ADR "for clarity" — a decision record that can be rewritten is marketing, not
  archaeology. Add an addendum.
- Regenerating `index.md` wholesale — the human introduction at the top is why the file is
  readable at all. Markers exist precisely to prevent this.
- Marking everything `expires_at` out of anxiety — expiry noise trains readers to ignore the field.
