# Slice Generalities Template

## Problem

A brownfield repo documented per file drowns in volume and rots at the first refactor, and docs
that never answer *"where does my task land?"* get ignored by every reader, human or machine. The
first artifact worth making is the territory map — one generalities doc per slice.

## Solution

Copy the fenced shape below: exactly one generalities doc per slice, answering what the slice is,
where its boundaries are, which paths a reader starts from, and what is honestly unwritten.
Slice membership is metadata, not a key: it rides on `category` and `tags` — there is **no**
`slice:` frontmatter key, and inventing keys is a metadata-outside-contract error (see
[../guidelines/04-validation.md](../guidelines/04-validation.md)).

## When to use

Brownfield Step 1 ([../guidelines/08-brownfield.md](../guidelines/08-brownfield.md)): every slice
row in the Slices table gets one of these, before anything else — the slices are the hubs of the
retrofit and the routing unit of the query loop.

## When not to use

Greenfield corpora (notes + hubs suffice); per-file documentation (a map at 1:1 scale is
impossible to keep fresh); walkthroughs and tutorials — a different document type, linked *from*
the generalities, never replacing them.

## Examples

# <Name> — Slice Generalities
## What this slice is        ← purpose, form ("files ARE the store" style)
## Boundaries                ← explicitly IN and OUT; what belongs elsewhere and where
## Entry points              ← paths a reader starts from; the next read is determined, not guessed
## How it works              ← generalities: main flows, data shape, state ownership — high level
## Conventions of this slice ← the rules that hold *here* (may differ corpus-wide)
## Dependencies              ← upstream (what this needs) / downstream (what breaks)
## Known gaps & accepted debt ← honest "this is broken/unwritten" — feeds the accepted-debt list
```

## Common mistakes

- Inventing frontmatter keys (`slice: <name>`, `description:` on a note) instead of expressing
  membership through the contract's `category` and `tags`.
- Writing a walkthrough: the doc is the map — what, where, boundaries, gaps — not a sequence of
  steps through the code.
- Skipping "Known gaps & accepted debt": documented incompleteness beats silent staleness, and
  the section is what the review pass (08 Step 5) calibrates against.
- One doc per file, or thirty slices: routing scales with areas (2–7), not with file count.
